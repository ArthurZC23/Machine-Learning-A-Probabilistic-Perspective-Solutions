# Machine-Learning-A-Probabilistic-Perspective-Solutions

## Motivation

Hey there. I am recording the solutions of the exercises of the **fourth printing** of this book in this repository. The only exercises that I do not intend to do in this first run are those which explicit require MATLAB. Any computational exercise will be done in Python using a Jupyter notebook. I will follow a schema where I give a introduction and some insight into the problem, solve it and then make some remarks on the solution. I strongly reccomend the reading of the Intro and Conclusion section of the exercises that you're interested in. I intend to update the solutions in a reasonable pace, starting now (January 2017). 

I hope this might help anyone who has an interest in the book and Machine Learning as a whole.
